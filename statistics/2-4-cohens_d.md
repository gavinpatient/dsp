[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

Using the built-in Cohen's d function embedding the call below into the chap02ex.py file returned a cohen's d value of -0.088672927072602 (which was the same as was returned by the solution python file). This is a slightly larger effect than the what was seen with the pregnancy length example in the chapter but still far too small for me to draw a real concolusion from.
